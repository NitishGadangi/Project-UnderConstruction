            So I recently found a velnerability in Saavn Rest API which enables you to access premium content directly. 
So I decided why not make an app, so that ever one can enjoy it. and this app is the result.

### Features:
* Download High-Quality Music .m4a (320kbps or 160kbps or 96kbps) directly into your local storage.
* Enabled ID3 tagging and Album art features.
* So every song will be compiled with song info and Album Art.
* Search Songs directly from Saavn Database with Search feature.
* (Experimental)Browse songs using Saavn Web ui.

### Things to consider:
* The app is still in beta. So having bugs is common. If you found any bug, please report it here [Telegram Group](https://t.me/joinchat/HH4B2xFVtt6_2hbJl_qKQA).
* This App is developed Lollipop (API level 22) as the base, so it should work flawlessly on Marshmallow and above devices.
* However, ID3 tagging and Album art feature is currently enabled for only for devices with Android Oreo(Api 26) and Above.
* Downloads page is still under development and will be released in next beta..

### What about next release?
**I will develop the next release once this release reach 200+ downloads..
* Will include online streaming feature with in the app.
* Revamp the downloads page.
* Make the app Smoother
* Add option to select between mp3 and m4a
* Add a toggle to enable or disable Album art Feature.

***The current app icon really looks like shit..ðŸ˜…..If you have any good icon suggestions please post it here [Telegram Group](https://t.me/joinchat/HH4B2xFVtt6_2hbJl_qKQA) or dm me..
